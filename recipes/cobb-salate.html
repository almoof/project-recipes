    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These strawberry butter swim biscuits are <em>perfectly</em> balancedâ€”tender and buttery, but also airy and moist with a subtle tang from buttermilk. <br> Studded with fresh strawberries and lightly sweet, they are <em>just as tasty for dessert as for breakfast</em>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Meat</strong>: This protein-packed Cobb salad calls for both bacon and chicken. </li>
