    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>A Cobb salad</em> is an American dish that consists of lettuce topped with bacon, chicken, boiled eggs, tomatoes, and other ingredients arranged in neat rows. <br> It is traditionally served as a main course. The origins of the classic salad is unclear, but many believe it was created in the late 1930s at the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood. </p>
