    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These strawberry butter swim biscuits are <em>perfectly</em> balanced—tender and buttery, but also airy and moist with a subtle tang from buttermilk. <br> Studded with fresh strawberries and lightly sweet, they are <em>just as tasty for dessert as for breakfast</em>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>2 cups whole buttermilk</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, divided</li>
      <li>3/4 cup chopped fresh strawberries, patted dry</li>
      <li>1/2 cup confectioners sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon buttermilk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Gather all ingredients.</em>
        <br>
        Preheat the oven to <strong>450 degrees F</strong> (<strong>235 degrees C</strong>).</li>
      <li><em>Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl; pour in 2 cups of the buttermilk and 3 tablespoons melted butter.</em>
        <br>
        Stir until almost fully combined but some dry streaks remain, about <strong>30 seconds</strong>. </li>
      <li><em>Gently fold in strawberries until evenly combined.</em></li>
      <li><em>Pour remaining 5 tablespoons melted butter into an 8-inch square baking dish; swirl the dish to evenly coat bottom and sides.</em>
        <br>
        Transfer dough to the prepared baking dish and gently spread into an even layer; cut biscuits into 9 even squares.</li>
      <li><em>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, <strong>30 to 35 minutes</strong>.</em>
        <br>
        Checking after 20 minutes and tent with foil if biscuits are browning too quickly.</li>
      <li><em>Remove from the oven and let rest in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes.</em>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, whisk confectioner’s sugar and 1 tablespoon buttermilk together in a small bowl until combined. Drizzle evenly over warm biscuits, slice, and serve while warm.</li>
