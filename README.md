This is my first project within TOP (The Odin Project) curriculum

To list my accomplishments:
  - Revised basics from school
  - Knew more about how internet works
  - Knew about tabnabbing
  - Got familiar with Git and Github
  - Got familiar with working in terminal (maybe i'll move to linux eventually)
  - Knew more about accessability

Difficulties:
  - For now not so much
  - But also pain when formatting plain text (e.g. making bold cuz it replaces or inserts without containing text)
  - Writing commit messages (at the beginning almost forgot about atomic commits)

That's all i guess

P.S. Be aware of desert of despair... It's coming
